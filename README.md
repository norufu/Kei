<h1>Kei</h1>
Kei is a customizable daily planner to keep track of progress on tasks. Able to pick from various widgets depending on which you want and design your dashboard however you like.

<h1>ScaleBox</h1>
ScaleBox component is what I made for the resizing and moving of widgets. A resizeable div that wraps the component, and when in scale mode the user can click and drag or click edges to resize. Snaps to grid on release to help with aligning widgets. The scalebox is shown as the yellow border in scale mode, with a little padding to make clicking the edge easier, and it snaps to fit the component inside upon release.
